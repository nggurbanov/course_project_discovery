# **Product Requirements Document: Project Discovery Platform**

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Author:** Gemini  
**Status:** In Development

### **1\. Overview & Vision**

#### **1.1. The Problem**

Students at the university currently face a significant challenge when selecting coursework projects. The primary source of information is a large, unstructured CSV file that is difficult to navigate, search, and understand. This inefficient process leads to several negative outcomes:

* **Missed Opportunities:** Students often overlook projects that are a perfect match for their skills and interests because they are buried in the data.  
* **Information Overload:** The sheer volume of text makes it difficult to compare projects effectively.  
* **Mismatched Pairings:** Supervisors receive applications from students who may not be the best fit, simply because the discovery process is not targeted.

#### **1.2. The Vision**

To create an intuitive, engaging, and centralized web platform that transforms the process of discovering and selecting coursework projects. Our vision is to empower students to easily find opportunities that match their academic goals and personal interests through powerful filtering, semantic search, and compelling interactive visualizations. This platform will become the single source of truth for all coursework project offerings.

### **2\. Product Goals & Business Objectives**

* **Primary Goal:** Increase student engagement and satisfaction with the project selection process.  
* **Secondary Goal:** Improve the quality of student-project matching, leading to better project outcomes.  
* **Business Objective:** Reduce the administrative overhead for both students and faculty during the project selection period.  
* **Strategic Objective:** Position the university as forward-thinking by leveraging modern technology (AI, data visualization) to improve the student experience.

### **4\. Functional Requirements & Features**

This section details the core functionalities of the platform, prioritized into P1 (Must-Have for MVP) and P2 (Should-Have).

#### **Epic 1: Core Project Discovery & Filtering**

| ID | Feature | Priority | Description & User Value |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **F1.1** | Global Search Bar | P1 | A prominent search bar on the main page. It will perform a keyword search across project\_title\_ru, project\_title\_en, and project\_annotation. **Value:** Allows for quick, direct searching. |
| **F1.2** | Filter by Supervisor | P1 | A filterable, searchable dropdown list populated with unique names from the ФИО руководителя column. **Value:** Allows students to find projects by a specific professor they wish to work with. |
| **F1.3** | Filter by Course | P1 | A set of checkboxes corresponding to the specific course columns (e.g., 3 курс "Анализ данных в бизнесе"). Users can select multiple courses. **Value:** Narrows down the list to only projects explicitly offered for their curriculum. |
| **F1.4** | Filter by Project Type & Format | P1 | Checkboxes for Тип проекта (e.g., "Программный," "Исследовательский") and Вид проекта (e.g., "Индивидуальный," "Командный"). **Value:** Helps students find projects that match their preferred work style. |
| **F1.5** | Filter by Thematic Tags | P1 | A visually distinct section of clickable tags (e.g., "Медицина", "Видеоигры", "LLM"). Clicking a tag filters the project list to show only projects with that tag. The tags will be pre-generated by an LLM. **Value:** Enables powerful, theme-based discovery beyond simple keywords. |
| **F1.6** | Project List View | P1 | A clean, card-based layout that displays the filtered list of projects. Each card will show the project title, supervisor, and the first few lines of the annotation. **Value:** Provides a scannable and easy-to-read overview of search results. |

#### **Epic 2: Interactive Constellation Map Visualization**

| ID | Feature | Priority | Description & User Value |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **F2.1** | Force-Directed Graph | P1 | An interactive graph visualization on the main page. It will represent supervisors, projects, and thematic tags as nodes, with edges connecting them based on their relationships. The layout algorithm will naturally cluster related projects. **Value:** Provides a highly engaging and intuitive way to explore the project landscape and discover thematic connections. |
| **F2.2** | Node Interactivity | P1 | \- Clicking a Supervisor or Tag node will highlight all connected Project nodes. \- Hovering over a Project node will display a tooltip with its title and supervisor. \- Clicking a Project node will navigate to its detail page. Value: Makes the visualization a functional and exploratory tool, not just a static image. |
| **F2.3** | Map Synchronization | P2 | The Constellation Map should update in real-time to reflect the active filters selected in the sidebar. For example, if a user filters by "Макаров Илья Андреевич", only that supervisor's "solar system" of projects should remain visible on the map. **Value:** Creates a unified and powerful discovery experience. |

#### **Epic 3: Content & Detail Pages**

| ID | Feature | Priority | Description & User Value |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **F3.1** | Project Detail Page | P1 | A unique, shareable URL for each project (e.g., /projects/ai-assistant-for-quantum). This page will present all information from the CSV for that project in a structured and readable format, including title, supervisor, all descriptions (Аннотация, Цель, Задачи), requirements, contact info, etc. **Value:** Acts as the single source of truth for a specific project. |
| **F3.2** | Supervisor Profile Page | P2 | A unique, shareable URL for each supervisor (e.g., /supervisors/mikhail-remnev). This page will display the supervisor's name and a list of all projects they currently offer. **Value:** Helps students understand a supervisor's areas of expertise and see all their offerings in one place. |

### **5\. Data & Content Strategy**

The platform's content will be derived from the темы проектов.csv file.

1. **Source File:** A semicolon-delimited CSV file named темы проектов.csv.  
2. **Data Processing:** An offline Python script will be run to process this CSV.  
3. **LLM Enrichment:** The script will use the Gemini API to analyze the Наименование проекта на русском and Аннотация проекта for each project.  
4. **Tagging:** Based on this analysis, the LLM will assign a set of predefined thematic tags from a master list. This creates a new tags attribute for each project.  
5. **Output:** The processed and enriched data will be saved as a JSON file, which will act as the static database for the web application's API.

### **6\. Design & UX Requirements**

* **Aesthetic:** Clean, modern, and academic. The design should inspire confidence and be easy to navigate. Use a consistent color palette and typography.  
* **Responsiveness:** The platform must be fully responsive and usable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
* **Interactivity:** All interactive elements (filters, buttons, graph nodes) must provide clear visual feedback (hover states, click effects).  
* **Performance:** The application, especially the graph visualization, must load quickly and perform smoothly even with hundreds of nodes.

### **7\. Success Metrics**

* **Adoption Rate:** % of students in target courses who use the platform at least once.  
* **Feature Engagement:**  
  * Number of searches performed per session.  
  * Average number of filters applied per session.  
  * Click-through rate on thematic tags.  
  * Interaction rate (clicks, hovers) with the Constellation Map.  
* **Qualitative Feedback:** Conduct short surveys with students and supervisors to gather feedback on usability and satisfaction.

### **8\. Future Scope (Post-MVP)**

* **Student "Favorites":** Allow students to "star" or "save" projects to a personal shortlist.  
* **Advanced Analytics:** A dashboard for administrators to view trends, such as the most popular tags or supervisors.  
* **Direct Application Link:** A button on the project page that links to the university's official application form, pre-filling the project title.  
* **Real-time Updates:** Move from an offline script to a system where data can be updated dynamically without redeploying the application.
